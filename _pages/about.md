# About Me

I'm a Principal Engineer with over 15 years of experience building robust data pipelines and IoT infrastructure that operate in the world's most challenging environments—from North Sea subsea installations to remote Scottish hillsides.

My career has been defined by a unique ability to transfer life-critical systems expertise across sectors. I started in oil & gas, designing electronics for extreme downhole conditions and leading subsea condition monitoring campaigns. That foundation in reliability engineering proved invaluable when I transitioned to agricultural technology, where I've spent the past four years building Scotland's largest rural IoT deployment.

## What I Do

I specialise in turning messy field telemetry into usable data products. Whether it's 1500+ sensors scattered across Scottish farms or subsea control systems on North Sea platforms, my focus remains consistent: build systems that work reliably in harsh conditions, deliver measurable business value, and serve the people who depend on them.

At SmartRural, I've architected comprehensive ERP platforms from scratch, automated device provisioning systems that eliminated 95% of manual processes, and led engineering delivery across nine government-funded agricultural projects worth over £2 million. My work has delivered quantifiable impact: £100k+ annual cost savings, 92% reductions in hosting expenses, and an 85% success rate in farmer technology adoption.

## Cross-Sector Expertise

What sets me apart is my proven ability to apply rigorous engineering principles across industries. The same systems thinking that ensured safety in life-critical subsea environments now drives reliable agricultural data infrastructure. I don't reinvent solutions—I adapt proven methodologies to new contexts, whether that's rural connectivity challenges, distributed sensor networks, or stakeholder alignment across complex cooperative structures.

## Technical Foundation

My technical stack spans embedded systems (C/C++, Python), wireless protocols (LoRaWAN, Cellular, BLE), cloud-based fleet management, and comprehensive data pipeline architecture. I'm conversant with industry standards including IEC 61508 (Functional Safety), IEC 61131 (Programmable Controllers), and ISO 13628-6 (Subsea Production Systems).

I hold an MEng in Artificial Intelligence & Electronics from Robert Gordon University, where I was one of only two graduates from my cohort of 80 to progress from HNC to MEng through academic excellence.

## Current Focus

I'm particularly interested in opportunities where cross-sector IoT expertise delivers strategic value—whether that's agricultural technology, industrial automation, conservation systems, or pharmaceutical applications. I thrive in roles that combine technical depth with strategic impact, building infrastructure that scales whilst maintaining reliability in challenging deployment environments.

Based in Fraserburgh, Scotland, I'm open to remote work and collaborative projects that leverage my unique combination of oil & gas rigour and agricultural technology innovation.
